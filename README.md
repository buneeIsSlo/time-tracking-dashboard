# Frontend Mentor - Time tracking dashboard

Hey! This is my solution to the [Time tracking dashboard challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/time-tracking-dashboard-UIQ7167Jw).

### Built with
- Partially semantic HTML
- CSS
- [CSS Animations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations)
- JavaScript
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [Anime.js](https://animejs.com/)

### What I learned 
- A deeper understanding of webpack.
- `childNodes` property returns a NodeList whereas `children` property returns an HTML collection.
- Setting `pointer-events: none;` to parent element and `pointer-events: auto` to child element helps with applying styles just to the child element on hover.

Initially I wasn't so sure of how I'd approach this challenge, but looking through both of their solutions I picked up some really useful things.
